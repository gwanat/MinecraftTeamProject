# MinecraftTeamProject

**TeamProjectMod** is a Minecraft mod created by Gabriela Marek, Gabriela Wanat, Michał Wojnar, and Dominik Czemerzyński. It adds new ores, blocks, items, and tools to expand the gameplay. You can find rare materials like Glacier Ore, use Glacier Shards and Ingots in crafting, and fight with special weapons like the Portal Stick and TurboKosa. The mod brings more variety to exploration, crafting, and combat.

The mod is made using Java and built with Gradle, which helps us manage and build the project easily. We also use Forge, which lets us connect our custom features with Minecraft and make everything work smoothly in the game.
